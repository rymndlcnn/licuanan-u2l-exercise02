## Takeaways from this exercise
Creating this simple portfolio website from scratch was an invaluable learning experience for me. Through this project, I gained practical skills in HTML and CSS that will serve me well as I continue pursuing front-end web development. Some key takeaways include:

</br>
The importance of planning out the structure and layout of a page before starting to code. Using a wireframe to visualize the positioning of elements saved time and helped me organize the content logically.

</br>
How powerful CSS is for styling web pages and designing the look and feel. I gained experience with CSS properties like flexbox for layout, and typography and color choices for aesthetics.

</br>
The value of semantic HTML tags like header, nav, section to structure the content meaningfully and improve 
accessibility. This will make the code more maintainable.

</br>
Techniques for responsive design using relative units and media queries to optimize display on varying screen sizes.

</br>
Ways to efficiently reuse CSS code, like using external stylesheets instead of inline styles. This improves code organization.

</br>
The process for publishing to GitHub pages to host the live website. Using version control improved my workflow.

</br>
Overall, this project gave me valuable hands-on practice developing a simple website from start to finish, and taught me web development skills and best practices that I will build on moving forward.
